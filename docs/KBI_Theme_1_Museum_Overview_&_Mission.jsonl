    "body": "The National Museum of Taiwan History (NMTH) is a national history museum dedicated to the study and public presentation of Taiwan's past. The museum is located in Annan District, Tainan City, in southern Taiwan, within a large park-like site that includes exhibition buildings, collection and administration facilities, and a lakeside environment. It operates under the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of China (Taiwan).\n\nNMTH officially opened to the public in 2011. Its establishment responded to the need for a national institution focused specifically on Taiwan's history, distinct from broader natural science or fine arts museums. From the outset, the museum has aimed to present Taiwan's history from multiple perspectives, emphasizing everyday life, diverse communities, and the experiences of ordinary people alongside political events and state narratives.\n\nThe museum's exhibitions and collections cover Taiwan's development from prehistory, through the periods of European maritime expansion, Dutch and Spanish colonial presence, the Qing Empire, Japanese rule, and the post-1945 Republic of China administration, up to contemporary democratic society. Rather than treating any single regime or community as the sole subject of history, NMTH highlights the island as a place where different peoples, cultures, and political powers have met, conflicted, and negotiated over time.\n\nAs a public history institution, NMTH integrates research, collecting, preservation, display, and education. The museum maintains large collections of artifacts, documents, photographs, audiovisual materials, and contemporary objects that document social movements and everyday life. It develops long-term exhibitions such as the main permanent exhibition on the story of Taiwan, along with special exhibitions that focus on particular themes, periods, or issues. The museum also offers guided tours, educational programs, and digital resources to serve school groups, researchers, families, and general visitors.\n\nIn addition to onsite activities, NMTH plays a broader role as a national platform for collaboration in the field of Taiwan history and museum practice. It cooperates with local museums, academic institutions, communities, and international partners to strengthen research on Taiwan's past and to share Taiwan's historical experiences with wider audiences.",
