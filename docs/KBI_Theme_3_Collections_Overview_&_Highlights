    "summary": "The National Museum of Taiwan History holds over 140,000 physical items documenting Taiwan's history and social-cultural changes, with 35%+ from public donations. Focus areas include Taiwan-world connections, historical trajectories, public history, everyday culture, and multicultural narratives. Strategies emphasize 'object stories' linking artifacts to people, events, and contexts, supported by advanced preservation tech and contemporary collecting for events like 318 Movement and COVID-19.",
    "body": "Since 2000, NMTH has built a collection of books/documents, artifacts, audiovisual materials, and Taiwan-related historical items totaling over 140,000 physical pieces. About 35% come from public donations, reflecting a public history ethos. The collection aims to preserve 'Taiwan Memory' through material evidence of generational lives and societal transformations.\n\nCollection strategies prioritize objects reflecting: Taiwan's global links, historical development paths, public scholarship, everyday (常民) culture, diverse ethnic groups, and multicultural dynamics. Emphasis is on 'object stories'—interpreting artifacts through their human, social, and historical contexts rather than isolated display.\n\nContemporary collecting captures current events firsthand, e.g., 318 Movement (Sunflower) artifacts and COVID-19 items, ensuring real-time documentation. Preservation includes climate-controlled storage, non-invasive tech, material science research, and public consultations. Digitization, 3D reproductions, and annual warehouse tours promote access.\n\nFuture goals: Enhance digital metadata, rights clearance, sustainability (e.g., green preservation), and public participation to construct Taiwan's cultural subjectivity through collections.",
