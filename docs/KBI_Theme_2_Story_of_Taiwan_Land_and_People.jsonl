    "title": "Permanent Exhibition: The Story of Taiwan: Land and People (斯土斯民：臺灣的故事)",
    "summary": "The permanent exhibition 'The Story of Taiwan: Land and People' presents Taiwan's history from prehistory to the present as a story of encounters between diverse peoples, cultures, and powers on the island. Structured in seven chronological units, it emphasizes pluralistic narratives, everyday life, public history, and interactive displays rather than a singular national or colonial storyline. Updated to version 2.0 'Island of Encounters' in recent years, it integrates digital tools like VR, 3D models, and audio histories to engage visitors in exploring Taiwan's multifaceted past.",
    "body": "The permanent exhibition 'The Story of Taiwan: Land and People' (斯土斯民：臺灣的故事) is the core of the National Museum of Taiwan History's presentation of Taiwan's historical development. Spanning the museum's main exhibition halls, it guides visitors through Taiwan's past from prehistoric settlements to contemporary society, framed as a dynamic island where different peoples have met, interacted, competed, and coexisted.\n\nThe exhibition adopts a public history approach, drawing on diverse sources including artifacts, documents, oral histories, photographs, films, and contemporary objects. It avoids a linear, state-centric narrative, instead highlighting multiple perspectives from indigenous peoples, migrants, colonizers, and modern citizens. Key themes include migration waves, cultural exchanges, social conflicts, and resilience in everyday life.\n\nStructurally, the exhibition is divided into seven chronological units, each posing core questions to provoke reflection (e.g., 'Who are the earliest Taiwanese?'). Interactive elements such as touchscreens, audio stations, VR reconstructions, and hands-on activities make history accessible to all ages. Version 2.0, titled 'Island of Encounters' (交會之島), incorporates recent research, digital enhancements, and public input to refresh the displays.\n\nThe exhibition serves as the foundation for the museum's educational programs, guided tours, thematic routes, and online digital versions. It encourages visitors to see themselves as part of the ongoing story, with sections on public participation and future imaginings.",

    "summary": "This opening unit explores prehistoric Taiwan as a hub of human migration and cultural formation. It addresses 'Who are the earliest Taiwanese?' through archaeological evidence of Austronesian settlements, early trade networks, and diverse lifeways, setting the stage for Taiwan as an island of encounters.",
    "body": "Unit 1 introduces Taiwan's deep history, beginning with prehistoric human arrivals around 5,000–6,000 years ago. Archaeological sites like Tsochen and Tapenkeng reveal early Austronesian-speaking peoples who developed farming, pottery, and maritime skills. The unit highlights Taiwan as a key node in ancient Austronesian expansion across the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\n\nDisplays include jade artifacts, stone tools, pottery, and reconstructions of ancient villages. Interactive maps show migration routes from mainland Asia and Southeast Asia. The narrative emphasizes environmental adaptation, early trade with neighboring regions, and the foundations of indigenous cultures that persist today.\n\nCore questions: Who were the first inhabitants? How did early societies form on this island? The unit challenges visitors to rethink Taiwan's origins beyond later colonial arrivals.",
